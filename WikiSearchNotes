Notes for the wikiSearch challenge!!!

Day 1.5 1-6-2017 -- 12:50pm-
--->Note when adding the script tags in the html document, be sure to put the actual .js document
under all the libraries because its dependent on the libraries to actually function...

wikipedia Random : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random
wikipedia call: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&titles=Main%20Page&prop=revisions&rvprop=content&format=json
                                                  action = opensearch & format = json & search = what+ever+here & limit= 15 & profile = normal
action: What you want to pull(in our case opensearch)
format: XML/Json/ we of course are using json
search: this uses the + symbol in place of a space....
limit: this limits the search to 15 results.
profile: ...? no clue normal seems approprate though...


What have I learned?
  I'm getting better at positioning different elements in html but i still need major practice
i learned that all that padding does is bulk up elements, margin actually separates them like I did
with the <li> elements.
  max-width comes in real handy when it comes to organizing a list into a background-color.

  Things to improve/learn for the next time

  * Learn how to stretch a background-color to fit all the elements on top of it
  *Start putting together some javascript to test out the page...
  try to script code so it'll make <li> elements based on the number of items it recieved..

  I guess that's it... try learning how to get the input from the search bar before anything...
and then test out the concept before you try to make the website look pretty....
  *I like the idea of having a relatively blank page before you show results, it makes it look a lot
better than having a blank page waiting for a user response.....Transformations?...Transitions?...
maybe simple ones....
