Notes for the wikiSearch challenge!!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 1.5 1-6-2017 -- 12:50pm-
--->Note when adding the script tags in the html document, be sure to put the actual .js document
under all the libraries because its dependent on the libraries to actually function...

wikipedia Random : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random
wikipedia call: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&titles=Main%20Page&prop=revisions&rvprop=content&format=json
                                                  action = opensearch & format = json & search = what+ever+here & limit= 15 & profile = normal
action: What you want to pull(in our case opensearch)
format: XML/Json/ we of course are using json
search: this uses the + symbol in place of a space....
limit: this limits the search to 15 results.
profile: ...? no clue normal seems approprate though...


What have I learned?
  I'm getting better at positioning different elements in html but i still need major practice
i learned that all that padding does is bulk up elements, margin actually separates them like I did
with the <li> elements.
  max-width comes in real handy when it comes to organizing a list into a background-color.

  Things to improve/learn for the next time

  * Learn how to stretch a background-color to fit all the elements on top of it
  *Start putting together some javascript to test out the page...
  try to script code so it'll make <li> elements based on the number of items it recieved..

  I guess that's it... try learning how to get the input from the search bar before anything...
and then test out the concept before you try to make the website look pretty....
  *I like the idea of having a relatively blank page before you show results, it makes it look a lot
better than having a blank page waiting for a user response.....Transformations?...Transitions?...
maybe simple ones....

----------------------------------------------------------
  I set up the keyup event so when the user presses enter on the
text input field it'll just return the value of whats in that field.
  ill be able to use that value in the API so i can search for whatever
the user typed.

  The way i made that key up function work was instead of
using the click event in the actual text input i used it on the
submit button, which is in the same form so if that is clicked
it's like the text input was clicked... So in theory it should
give the same result.
  return false; prevents the page from reloading after the click
event is triggered.....

  ok so i made the website functional today after some rigorous thinking and
testing. The part that took me the longest to code was the actual function..
Figuring out which loop should loop how many times was a thinker but it didn't take
too long.
  embarrassingly enough the part that took most of my time was adding the html
from the jquery to the actual page. It wasn't that i was using the wrong method
or jquery tool. It was because the results were hidden under some scaffolding <li> elements.
It took me half an hour to figure out what i probably accomplished the first try.
That coupled with correcting simple syntax and logic errors i think ive spent a bad hour
chasing my own tail....
  Besides that I'm happy how the functionality worked. I even added a break in the
loops in case the wiki articles run out before 10!! It was a simple implementation
to the already written code and it felt soooo satisfying seeing it work so smoothly
on the first couple of tries too!!
    I think i deserve a gold star for my efforts today. I guess allowing myself
some time to blow up pirate spaceships and make a profit through trade!

- - - - What i need to do tomorrow to finish up the page.
    -- Find a way to clear the page after when the user wants to search another query
    -- Add a random button on the page somewhere
    -- That should fufil the requirements for the project
    --If you're feeling bored you could try to add some transitions and transform
animations to make it look pretty. YOU NEED A LOT OF PRACTICE IN THAT REGARD!!
